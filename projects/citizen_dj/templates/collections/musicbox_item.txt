This audio recording is part of the [Dyann Arthur and Rick Arthur collection of MusicBox Project materials](https://lccn.loc.gov/2019655209) at the Library of Congress. In January 2010 Dyann Arthur, independent folklorist, musicologist and Berklee College of Music alumni, founded [MusicBox Project](http://www.musicboxproject.org/), a non-profit corporation in the state of Washington, whose mission it is to document and preserve our musical history while advancing music education and occupational avenues of creation and performance. Beginning in 2009, Dyann and Rick Arthur travelled through America meeting and interviewing women musicians of all ages and career levels. "Americana Women" was conceived as a three-pronged research approach: 1) an oral history interview; 2) an acoustic performance at the time and place of the interview; 3) a public performance.
